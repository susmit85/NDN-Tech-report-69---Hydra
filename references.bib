    abstract = {Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have become indispensable to Internet content distribution. As they evolve to meet the ever-increasing demands, they are also facing challenges such as system complexity, resource footprint, and content security. In this paper, we look at CDNs once again, but this time from the eyes of a young networking technology called named-data networking (NDN). NDN supports content distribution without requiring an overlay service to bridge the gap between network services and application needs. Therefore, it can realize content distribution at large scale with an arguably simpler system design.We conducted real-world experiments to compare the standard deployment of NDN (i.e., the global NDN testbed) and two leading CDNs (Akamai and Fastly) in terms of caching and retrieving static contents through streaming videos from four different continents over these networks for two weeks. We found that although NDN can provide a satisfactory quality of service in most cases, it falls behind CDNs mainly due to its lack of hardware infrastructure and software/protocol immaturity. Nevertheless, NDN outperforms CDNs in terms of server workload and failure resiliency due to its ubiquitous in-network caching and adaptive forwarding plane. Besides, NDN comes with built-in content security, but it needs an efficient solution for content privacy. NDN's architectural advantages make it a natural fit for Internet content distribution in the long run. That said, in terms of forthcoming goals, this paper reveals several limitations of the current NDN deployment and discusses why the future of NDN hinges on addressing those limitations.},

ABSTRACT={Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) is a popular API used by today's distributed
multiparty applications. TCP/IP, however, does not directly support
multiparty communication, therefore realizing pub/sub requires complex
logic at the application layer. In this paper, we introduce SVS-PS, a
brokerless pub/sub protocol running over NDN. SVS-PS utilizes NDN for
data-centric security and many-to-many communication. Compared to IP-based
implementations, SVS-PS enables publishers and subscribers to rendezvous
{"}in the air{"}, thereby reduces the complexity of the application layer
and lowers network traffic load. Our open-source implementation of SVS-PS
makes NDN's networking primitives transparent to applications, allowing
developers to work with a familiar pub/sub API while benefiting from NDN's
secure and resilient multiparty communication support.}

    abstract = {Data naming is the most critical construct of Named Data Networking (NDN). The way a piece of content is named has profound impacts on content discovery, routing of user requests, data retrieval, and security. Besides, the naming of individual pieces of content seriously affects how the network behaves. While names are ubiquitous in NDN, the design choices for content names and how they affect the network have largely been overlooked. NDN applications and protocols usually name content to fit their particular application scenarios, often derived from existing naming conventions. However, these ad-hoc naming schemes often ignore the impact of these names on the network and the applications themselves. Drawing upon our experience in applying NDN to multiple science domains, we point out different exiting naming schemes in scientific communities, how we translated these names into NDN names, and the effect of naming on the network. Based on these observations, we provide a set of naming guidelines for future scientific applications and network operators supporting those applications.},

However, solely cloud-based services are not the ideal solution for all use cases, in particular, the case of high volume data sharing in scientific computing whose cloud usage costs could be prohibitively high. Thus we take on a task of building a distributed, federated data repository, dubbed Hydra, for sharing large volume scientific data. In this paper, we compare two design choices: designing Hydra over TCP/IP with a centralized controller, and designing Hydra over Named Data Network (NDN) to enable distributed control. Our study shows that (i) building Hydra over TCP/IP with a central controller offers a simple, straightforward design; (ii) however, the controller necessarily needs to be replicated for scalability and reliability, and cloud CDN is needed to scale data delivery, both bringing additional complexity into the overall design; and (iii) building Hydra over NDN automatically offers scalable and efficient data dissemination at volume, as well as enables distributed control with high resiliency.},
