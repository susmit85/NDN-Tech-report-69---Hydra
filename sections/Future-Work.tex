\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future-work}
While designing and implementing Hydra, many complex improvements stood out as future work.

First, Favor begs to be explored deeply. Not only will we look into different Favor formulas, but also we plan on allowing Favor to be "per file" instead of "per node".

Second, continue to enhance the current data fetching module to improve hydra's ability to reliably handle large files. Third, improve the replication mechanism to reduce replication latency while maintaining a desired degree of replication. Fourth, improve the latency of SVS, maintain a more rigid and consistent global view to improve system efficiency. Fifth, in order to better maintain storage limits and further improve the performance of the garbage collection process, a reasonable estimate of the time limit for purging expired data is required. Last but not least, we plan to improve Hydra's usability by reducing or addressing some of our assumptions. We also plan to increase integration via Archway or other modules (like supporting more node policies) for more specific control over the environment, and continue to make Hydra modular and more adaptable to the environment.
