\section{Hydra Operational Details} \label{sec:data-operations}

To demonstrate how Hydra performs data operations, we will utilize an initial deployment on FABRIC\cite{}.

For the scenario, all of the following FABRIC sites have a Hydra node:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clemson
    \item StarLight
    \item Washington
    \item Dallas
    \item Salt Lake City
    \item San Diego
\end{itemize}

\jcp{talk about the command table}

Imagine the scenario where Clemson's Genomics and Bioinformatics facility decides to use Hydra to store pre-processed (i.e. indexed) genomes. The main goal of this exercise is to allow data access for the researchers and their collaborators in a reliable manner.
%for themselves and others to use this data without spending valuable resources on the genome indexing pre-processing step. 

A user can download the correct set of files and insert into downstream analytic workflows simply by asking for these datasets by name. \jcp{why does the user care about this?}

%Hydra will dramatically simplify data processing. Of course, they are able to re-process the raw genome data files if needed.
