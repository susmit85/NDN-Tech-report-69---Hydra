Firm Decisions
* Sending Commands - PubSub Way (Ping Flood DDoS, RTT increase)
* Storage Management - Federated, no local node control (ensuring end user control?)
* External Look into Hydra - Queries, global view info
* Granularity of Data - File Level (massive files?)
* Node Equality - All actions, roles, and controls are equal
* Minimal operation requires 3+1 nodes
* No Compromised nodes
* Data Retrieval - ForwardingHint instead of Passthrough
* Baseline Replication Factor of 3, 3 for backup also


Unsure Decisions
* File Favor Calculation / Favor Thresholds
* Prefix, Size Node Preferences (avoidance of irrelevant files on node)
* How to select nodes to forward to
* When to delete node info / when to step up and take place / How to handle network outages - HDFS/CASSANDRA
* Ordering of Commands / Handling Multi-cast Commands
* Global Favor or Individual File Favor Declaration
* How to join / rejoin back into the System
* How snapshots are going to work

Modules
* Effortless Local Policy (Mitéra or Ananke)
    - 'Touching' Files - Files default with month duration
    - Template for Users to state local policy
    - File Replication Popularity Handler
* Automatic Corrupted Node Detection (Phobos or Artemis)
* Logging (Mnemosyne)
* Security (Securitas)
* Some Type of Favor Module (Aphrodite)
* Snapshots
* Admin Queries or Monitoring (Ichnaea)


Questions:

Is the interest metadata stored in a database or in the named file in the network?
Do we need a trigger’ to load data dynamically the testbed?
How does the NDN container function with GEMMaker?
How do we create faces/routes via his Data Transfer Pod (DTP)?
